To Do:
-


Functions:
-When selling a car to Cardelare, the customer sends an initial offer. Admin 
accounts will recieve all offers. Admins could have specialities where they 
are proffesionals in a certain car type(eg: sports cars). Where they only get
sports car offers and can send counter offers. After an admin approves a deal
the car will have been sold and the customer might get sent an email that 
Cardelare will come to their address to pick up the car in 2-3 business days.



Ideas:
-Make "whats popular" button on home page where it shows the most rented
car types or individual car.(For customers that dont know what to look for) or 
a star system, out of 5.
