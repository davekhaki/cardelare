To Do:
-Make admin page
-Make proper database entries
-Make price input boxes increment by 10, dont allow negative value
-Save rented cars connected to users ( rented cars db table, user id and car id connected)
-Popup with javascript for wrong credentials.

Home Page:
-Implement Search button
-Make Brand,Model,City inputs into comboboxes by getting values from database

Search Result Page:
-Brand,Model,City,Fueltype, Transmission into comboboxes. Value from db
-Distance driven input into number input, increment by.
-Implement Advanced filtering

Profile Page: 
-Get info of logged in user and display it in profile page
-Implement profile detail edit 

Sell Car Page:
-Send offer implementation, for now just upload it into a "Pending offers" db table
-Change price input box into number input box(eg: home price boxes)


Ideas:
-Make "whats popular" button on home page where it shows the most rented
car types or individual car.(For customers that dont know what to look for) or 
a star system, out of 5.
-When selling a car to Cardelare, the customer sends an initial offer. Admin 
accounts will recieve all offers. Admins could have specialities where they 
are proffesionals in a certain car type(eg: sports cars). Where they only get
sports car offers and can send counter offers. After an admin approves a deal
the car will have been sold and the customer might get sent an email that 
Cardelare will come to their address to pick up the car in 2-3 business days.
